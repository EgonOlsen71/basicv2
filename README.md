# basicv2

A Commodore BASIC V2 interpreter/compiler written in Java.

BasicV2 is an attempt to write a BASIC interpreter/compiler in Java that is compatible with the BASIC dialect that older 
Commodore home computers  were using. It can run BASIC programs written in BASIC V2 or ANSI BASIC.
It doesn't use any parts of the implementation of the original Commodore BASIC like similar projects do. 
It's a complete reimplementation in Java.

The sources come in a basic Maven like project structure as an Eclipse project. However, it doesn't actually use Maven and it has no
dependencies on any other Java libraries. It's a stand-alone thing.

It can run BASIC programs from inside your application or from the command line. 
You can even use it to process HTML-templates as it comes with a basic templating implementation.
